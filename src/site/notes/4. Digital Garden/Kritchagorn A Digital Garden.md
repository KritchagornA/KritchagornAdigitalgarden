# Introduction
I'm a lifelong learner on a mission to become a leading Data Engineer. Starting from a non-traditional background, I've upskilled through real projects, certifications, and hands-on experimentation with tools like mainly SQL, Python, Microsoft, and Azure. I believe in data as a tool for transformation and am actively building toward a career that combines engineering excellence with leadership in business intelligence.
